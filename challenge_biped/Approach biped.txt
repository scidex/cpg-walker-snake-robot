1. Only control hip, knee | ankle fixed
2. figure out phase, amplitude
3. copy to other body side (180Â° phase shift)
4. control ankle


1. Make two neurons oscillate nicely!


# TODOs:
How to implement phase, amplitude?
1. How can we generate Fig. 2 output?
2. How can we change the amplitude?
3. How can we change the frequency?
4. How can we change the phase (shifting / at which point does it start)?
